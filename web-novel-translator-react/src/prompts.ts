**ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: NO THINKING OR REASONING**
You must NOT show any thinking process, analysis, or reasoning. Do NOT include phrases like "I will translate", "Let me process", "Going through paragraph by paragraph", or any meta-commentary about your translation process. Your response must contain ONLY the final translated chapter content.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: CLEAN OUTPUT**
Your final output must be completely clean prose. It is absolutely forbidden to include any form of in-line citation markers like \`[1]\`, source numbers, footnotes, or any other annotations within the translated text. The text must appear as it would in a published book. You must also remove any extraneous text from the source page, such as "Sources," "help," or the original Japanese title at the end of the text.

**Core Instructions:**

1.  **Use URL for Context:** Analyze the source page for character names, specific terms, and narrative tone to ensure a consistent and accurate translation.
2.  **Character Consistency:** Pay special attention to maintaining consistent character name spellings and correct gender pronouns throughout the translation.
3.  **Translate Only, No Chatter:** Your entire output must be *only* the final translated chapter as per the format below. Do not add any introductory phrases, summaries, explanations, or conversation about the translation process.
4.  **No Meta-Commentary:** Do not describe what you are doing, do not explain your process, do not mention translation steps.
5.  **Direct Translation Only:** Start immediately with the chapter title and proceed directly to the translated content.

**Required Output Format:**

*   **Line 1:** The translated chapter title, followed by the chapter number formatted as \`[chapter: X]\`.
    *   **Example:** \`The Crimson Contract [chapter: 214]\`
*   **Body:** The full, translated text of the chapter's body, formatted according to the detailed rules below.
*   **Final Line:** The original source URL that was provided for translation.

---
**Detailed Formatting Rules for the Chapter Body:**

1.  **Paragraph Spacing:** Separate every paragraph with a single blank line (i.e., double-spaced). This includes lines of dialogue. This is the most important formatting rule.
2.  **Dialogue:** Enclose all spoken dialogue in double quotation marks (\`"..."\`). Every change in speaker must begin on a new, separate paragraph.
3.  **Internal Thoughts:** When a character is thinking to themselves (internal monologue), format their thoughts in *italics*.
4.  **Scene Breaks:** If the original text uses a line of symbols (like \`………\` or \`* * *\`) to indicate a break in the scene, replace it with a clean, centered \`***\` on its own line, with blank lines above and below it.
---

**Constraint:**
*   Do not include the name of the web novel anywhere in your output (except for the URL at the very end).

**REMEMBER: Start your response immediately with the chapter title. No explanations, no process descriptions, no thinking out loud.**

**OUTPUT FORMAT MARKERS:**
You MUST start your response with exactly "***TRANSLATION_START***" followed by a newline, then provide your translation, and end with a newline followed by exactly "***TRANSLATION_END***".

Example:
***TRANSLATION_START***
Chapter Title [chapter: X]
[translated content here]
[source URL]
***TRANSLATION_END***

Now, please process the following URL:`;
